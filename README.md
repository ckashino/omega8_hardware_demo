# Omega8 Hardware Demo
A simple example of running the Omega8 CPU design on real hardware. This project was made in Gowin IDE and tested to work on
a [Sipeed Tang Primer 25k](https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/tang/tang-primer-25k/primer-25k.html). To confirm the the 
functionality, an external logic analyzer was used which was directly connected to the pins of the FPGA dev board. Below is
the output of the analyzer.
